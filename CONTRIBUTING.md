## üêû Issues and Pull requests

- We value contributions in the form of discussions or suggestions. We recommend taking a look at existing issues and our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/arc53/projects/2).


- If you're interested in contributing code, here are some important things to know:

Before creating issues, please check out how the latest version of our app looks and works by launching it via [Quickstart](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT#quickstart) the version on our live demo is slightly modified with login. Your issues should relate to the version you can launch via [Quickstart](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT#quickstart).

### üë®‚Äçüíª If you're interested in contributing code, here are some important things to know:

For instructions on setting up a development environment, please refer to our [Development Deployment Guide](https://docs.docsgpt.cloud/Deploying/Development-Environment).

Tech Stack Overview:

- üåê Frontend: Built with React (Vite) ‚öõÔ∏è,

- üñ• Backend: Developed in Python üêç

### üåê Frontend Contributions (‚öõÔ∏è React, Vite)

*   The updated Figma design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/OXLtrl1EAy885to6S69554/DocsGPT?node-id=0%3A1&t=hjWVuxRg9yi5YkJ9-1).  Please try to follow the guidelines.
*   **Coding Style:** We follow a strict coding style enforced by ESLint and Prettier. Please ensure your code adheres to the configuration provided in our repository's `frontend/.eslintrc.js` file.  We recommend configuring your editor with ESLint and Prettier to help with this.
* **Component Structure:** Strive for small, reusable components.  Favor functional components and hooks over class components where possible.
* **State Management** If you need to add stores, please use Redux.

### üñ• Backend Contributions (üêç Python)

- Review our issues and contribute to [`/application`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/application) 
- All new code should be covered with unit tests ([pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)). Please find tests under [`/tests`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/tests) folder.
- Before submitting your Pull Request, ensure it can be queried after ingesting some test data.
- **Coding Style:** We adhere to the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code. We use `ruff` as our linter and code formatter.  Please ensure your code is formatted correctly and passes `ruff` checks before submitting.
- **Type Hinting:**  Please use type hints for all function arguments and return values. This improves code readability and helps catch errors early.  Example:

    ```python
    def my_function(name: str, count: int) -> list[str]:
        ...
    ```
- **Docstrings:**  All functions and classes should have docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.  We prefer the [Google style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). Example:

    ```python
    def my_function(name: str, count: int) -> list[str]:
        """Does something with a name and a count.

        Args:
            name: The name to use.
            count: The number of times to do it.

        Returns:
            A list of strings.
        """
        ...
    ```
  
### Testing

To run unit tests from the root of the repository, execute:
```
python -m pytest
```
