# Port Conflicts & Solutions

<Callout type="warning">If you cannot access DocsGPT on the expected port, you may have a port conflict. See below for solutions.</Callout>

When running DocsGPT locally, you may encounter port conflicts if another application is already using a required port (e.g., 5173, 7091, 6379, 27017).

## How to Detect a Port Conflict

- **On Windows:**  
  `netstat -ano | findstr :5173`
- **On Mac/Linux:**  
  `lsof -i :5173`

If you see output, another process is using the port.

## How to Change the Port

In your `docker-compose.yaml`, change the left side of the port mapping:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5174:5173"
```
Now, access the app at `http://localhost:5174`.

> **Note:** In the port mapping (`5174:5173`), the number on the right (`5173`) is the internal port used by the Docker container (DocsGPT app), while the number on the left (`5174`) is the external port exposed on your computer (host). You can change the left side to any available port if you have a conflict. The right side should match the port the app listens to inside the container.

## Common Ports Used

| Service   | Default Port |
|-----------|--------------|
| Frontend  | 5173         |
| Backend   | 7091         |
| Redis     | 6379         |
| MongoDB   | 27017        |

## FAQ

**Q: I changed the port but still can't access the app?**  
A: Make sure to use the new port in your browser and restart Docker Compose.

**Q: How do I know which process is using a port?**  
A: Use the commands above to find the process ID, then stop or change that process.

**Q: Can I use any port number?**  
A: Yes, as long as it is not already in use and is allowed by your firewall/security settings.
