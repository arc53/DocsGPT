QUESTION: How to merge tables in pandas?
=========
Content: pandas provides various facilities for easily combining together Series or DataFrame with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations.
Source: 28-pl
Content: pandas provides a single function, merge(), as the entry point for all standard database join operations between DataFrame or named Series objects: \n\npandas.merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=False, suffixes=('_x', '_y'), copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)

FINAL ANSWER: To merge two tables in pandas, you can use the pd.merge() function. The basic syntax is: \n\npd.merge(left, right, on, how) \n\nwhere left and right are the two tables to merge, on is the column to merge on, and how is the type of merge to perform. \n\nFor example, to merge the two tables df1 and df2 on the column 'id', you can use: \n\npd.merge(df1, df2, on='id', how='inner')
